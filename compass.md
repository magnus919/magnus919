**This is very much an early rough draft that needs polishing.**

# Compass - Magnus Hedemark

This document will aim to capture my purpose in life, my vision, and my mission. This is something I can refer back to when making big decisions. And it can also help people who work with me to understand my motives.

## Purpose (_why?_)

> Liberate latent potential.

This latent potential exists in myself, in other individuals, and in collections of individuals.

We do much to hold ourselves back internally. And we do much to hold others back around us.

## Vision (_what?_)

> Discover new ways of doing business, _by doing it_, that will liberate latent potential in the organization, its workers, its customers, and the communities we serve.

## Mission (_how?_)

> By running a business that intentionally pushes boundaries out that currently limit human potential, we enable ourselves and those around us to lead more fulfilling lives. We will lead by example, first discovering what's possible for ourselves, and then helping other organizations to take up these methods.

I've got a particular interest in helping Autistic and Neurodivergent people, intersectionality with the broader Disabled community, LGTBQ+, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, etc. 

## Values

It's one thing to say what you value. But it's another to ask others around you what they think you value based on your deeds. I'm going to split this up into _observed_ values that I want to continue to exude, but also _latent_ values that I hold dear internally, but I could do a better job of making observable.

### Observed

- Authenticity
- Transparency
- Honesty
- Directness
- Equity
- Inclusion
- Diversity
- Rationality
- What we do matters
- Self-awareness
- Relentless self-improvement
- Curiosity
- Making a positive difference for others
- Social justice
- Family
- Doing the right thing
- Transforming dysfunctional systems
- Fixing (or replacing) things that seem too hard to fix


### Latent
- Doing the thing right (counter-balancing _doing the right thing_)
- Empathy (feeling what others feel)
- Sympathy (understanding others feelings... the _why_)
- Compassion (feeling what others feel, understanding those feelings, and taking stake in the outcome)

## What makes me tick?

These questions were provided to me via Dr. Nicole Radziwill & Rajesh Anandan of [Ultranauts](https://ultranauts.co).

### What motivates you/makes you tick?

Finding, exploring, and nurturing hidden potential. Both in myself and in others. And, taken in meta, the hidden potential of groups of people.

### What do you want to achieve personally in the next decade?

I know I have a lot of stories in me, but I've been struggling with finding the attention span to finish writing *one* (vs. finding it easy to start *many*). I like to write, and I think I'm not bad at it. I'd like to do something more substantial with that.

### What do you want to achieve professionally in the next decade?

I want to start the kind of business that I'd prefer to work for. I want to have the kind of accountability where the most serious organizational challenges are within my ability to heavily influence better outcomes. I think I'm hitting a wall right now because of constraints from other departments where I have no influence or accountability (finance, HR, etc). I want to experiment with what the work day and work force looks like in a way where old norms can get a fresh look, and possibly treated to some radical change experiments. And I want to share what I learn.

### What do you want to achieve professionally in the next 2-3 years?

I want to learn the skills I need to start and grow my own business. I have a lot of experience leading large teams of technologists, and as broad as that scope of responsibility comes, it's still siloed to technology leadership. To become a more effective leader, I need to get some more holistic experience building and growing a business or line of business.

### Are there any responsibilities you have outside of your day-job that you want your peers to know about?

I really enjoy podcasting and photography. Sometimes I can sneak these passions into my day job, and when I can it gives me a lot of joy. 

I do set aside a nice chunk of my personal time for helping out other programs that are helping Autistic adults. It's important to me that these programs succeed, and it's also important to me that they have more influence from successful Autistic adults (so that the often Allistic leaders of these programs gets effective input on what Autistic adults may need to become more successful and independent).

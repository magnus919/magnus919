**This is very much an early rough draft that needs polishing.**

# Compass - Magnus Hedemark

This document will aim to capture my purpose in life, my vision, and my mission. This is something I can refer back to when making big decisions. And it can also help people who work with me to understand my motives.

## Purpose (_why?_)

> Liberate latent potential.

This latent potential exists in myself, in other individuals, and in collections of individuals.

We do much to hold ourselves back internally. And we do much to hold others back around us.

## Vision (_what?_)

> Discover new ways of doing business, _by doing it_, that will liberate latent potential in the organization, its workers, its customers, and the communities we serve.

## Mission (_how?_)

> By running a business that intentionally pushes boundaries out that currently limit human potential, we enable ourselves and those around us to lead more fulfilling lives. We will lead by example, first discovering what's possible for ourselves, and then helping other organizations to take up these methods.

I've got a particular interest in helping Autistic and Neurodivergent people, intersectionality with the broader Disabled community, LGTBQ+, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, etc. 

## Values

It's one thing to say what you value. But it's another to ask others around you what they think you value based on your deeds. I'm going to split this up into _observed_ values that I want to continue to exude, but also _latent_ values that I hold dear internally, but I could do a better job of making observable.

### Observed

- Authenticity
- Transparency
- Honesty
- Directness
- Equity
- Inclusion
- Diversity
- Rationality
- What we do matters
- Self-awareness
- Relentless self-improvement
- Curiosity
- Making a positive difference for others
- Social justice
- Family
- Doing the right thing
- Transforming dysfunctional systems
- Fixing (or replacing) things that seem too hard to fix


### Latent
- Doing the thing right (counter-balancing _doing the right thing_)
- Empathy (feeling what others feel)
- Sympathy (understanding others feelings... the _why_)
- Compassion (feeling what others feel, understanding those feelings, and taking stake in the outcome)

# Magnus Hedemark

## Quick View

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on leading Gap Inc's cloud infrastructure strategy. I'm also working in an advisory capacity for Ultranauts, NCSU Students Moving Forward, and Stanford Neurodiversity Project's Employment Taskforce. And somewhere in there I'm finding time to produce podcasts, including _Neuroverse_ and _Autism-First Language_.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about _Autism at Work_ and _Neurodiversity_.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have the same username on Twitter and Instagram. I'm easy to find on LinkedIn. If I don't already know you, I probably don't want our first encounter to happen through email or private message.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Tech is just one of many far-flung interests. I could have just as easily gone into a different field if I thought I could make steady income from it.

## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Magnus. I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my family. We're originally from the Philadelphia area, but have been in Raleigh a long time. I'm Autistic and ADHD, and I've chosen to be open about it in order to help normalize Autism acceptance and advocate for better opportunities for Neurodivergent people to succeed in life.

I'm currently (Sept 2021) working as a Senior Director in the TechOps product portfolio at Gap Inc. My work is focused on deliverying cloud services to GapTech application product teams, as well as leading other functions like Site Reliability Engineering. Prior to switching to a leadership career path, I spent a large part of my career as a SysAdmin / Systems Engineer and had a lot of fun as the DevOps movement found its footing to incorporate Agile ways of working into my field, and find better ways for Ops to work more effectively with other functions to deliver on our shared goals.

I'm not actively contributing code on GitHub (this is just not in my core strengths). But you'll see me poking around in a lot of areas relating to home automation, possibly also image processing for my photography hobby.

## Quick View

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a solopreneur via my own company, Groktopus LLC. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about _Autism at Work_ and _Neurodiversity_.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have the same username on ~~Twitter~~ (Twitter is deactivated) and Instagram. I'm easy to find on LinkedIn. If I don't already know you, I probably don't want our first encounter to happen through email or private message.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Tech is just one of many far-flung interests. I could have just as easily gone into a different field if I thought I could make steady income from it.

## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Magnus. I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my family. We're originally from the Philadelphia area, but have been in Raleigh a long time. I'm Autistic and ADHD, and I've chosen to be open about it in order to help normalize Autism acceptance and advocate for better opportunities for Neurodivergent people to succeed in life.

I'm currently (Jan 2023) working as a solopreneur until I find a role that I can really love. 

I recently came off a great temp gig as Interim CIO at [Genius Within CIC](https://geniuswithin.org). Some of the highlights of that assignment:
* Helping a non-technology company to launch an MVP of their first technology product, the GeniusFinder Pro.
* Helping them to pick up some leadership tools that will help them as they grow. Better product portfolio management, project management, and sales pipeline tools and practices.

Most of my work over the past ~7 years has been focused on deliverying cloud services to application product teams (particularly at Optum/UnitedHealth and Gap Inc), as well as leading other functions like Site Reliability Engineering. Prior to switching to a leadership career path, I spent a large part of my career as a SysAdmin / Systems Engineer and had a lot of fun as the DevOps movement found its footing to incorporate Agile ways of working into my field, and find better ways for Ops to work more effectively with other functions to deliver on our shared goals.

I'm not actively contributing code on GitHub (this is just not in my core strengths). But you'll see me poking around in a lot of areas relating to home automation, possibly also image processing for my photography hobby.
